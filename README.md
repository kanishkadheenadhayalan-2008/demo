Kanishka —

First, congratulations on the strong 92.8% in your 12th — that shows you already have discipline and the ability to learn hard things. 
It’s perfectly okay that you come from a biology background; many successful engineers began exactly where you are now. 
Your interest in Python and problem-solving is the most important thing — that curiosity will carry you a long way. 
I’m proud to have you in class and I’ll support you step-by-step so you gain confidence and skill in programming.
